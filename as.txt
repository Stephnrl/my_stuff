Ticket Summary
Subject: Establish AWS EKS Worker Node Baseline using Bottlerocket FIPS OS
Priority: Medium
Category: Infrastructure/Platform Services
Subcategory: Container Platform
Business Justification
Establish a standardized, compliant baseline for AWS EKS worker nodes to support containerized workloads in our DoD/FedRAMP environment while maintaining required security posture and compliance standards.
Detailed Description
Objective
Create and document a standard baseline configuration for AWS EKS worker nodes using Bottlerocket FIPS as the base operating system for all managed node groups within our AWS GovCloud environment.
Scope

Define standard AMI configuration for EKS worker nodes
Establish security hardening guidelines
Document compliance alignment with DoD/FedRAMP requirements
Create standardized node group templates
Implement monitoring and logging standards

Technical Requirements

Operating System: Bottlerocket FIPS-enabled AMI
Compliance: DoD/FedRAMP High baseline compliance
Environment: AWS GovCloud
Container Runtime: containerd (Bottlerocket default)
Kubernetes Version: Latest supported EKS version
Security: FIPS 140-2 Level 1 cryptographic modules

Justification for Bottlerocket FIPS over AL2/AL2023
Security Advantages

Minimal Attack Surface: Purpose-built container OS with only essential components
FIPS Compliance: Built-in FIPS 140-2 Level 1 validated cryptographic modules
Immutable Infrastructure: Read-only root filesystem reduces configuration drift
Security Hardening: Default security configurations aligned with DoD STIG requirements

Operational Benefits

Reduced Maintenance: Automatic security updates through managed AMI updates
Performance Optimization: Container-optimized kernel and userspace
Resource Efficiency: Lower memory footprint and faster boot times
AWS Integration: Native integration with EKS, SSM, and CloudWatch

Compliance Alignment

FedRAMP High: Meets control requirements for government workloads
DoD Cloud Computing SRG: Aligned with DoD security requirements
NIST Standards: Built with NIST cybersecurity framework principles

Deliverables

Documented EKS worker node baseline configuration
Standard AMI selection and configuration process
Security hardening checklist and validation procedures
Compliance mapping documentation
Implementation playbook and automation templates
Monitoring and alerting configuration standards

Implementation Timeline

Week 1-2: Requirements gathering and design
Week 3-4: Configuration development and testing
Week 5: Documentation and validation
Week 6: Stakeholder review and approval

Risk Assessment

Low Risk: Using AWS managed service with proven security track record
Mitigation: Comprehensive testing in non-production environment first
Compliance Risk: Minimal - Bottlerocket FIPS designed for government use

Success Criteria

Standardized, repeatable EKS worker node deployment process
100% compliance with DoD/FedRAMP security requirements
Documented baseline that can be audited and maintained
Reduced time-to-deployment for new EKS clusters

Dependencies

AWS GovCloud account access and permissions
EKS cluster networking and security group configurations
IAM roles and policies for worker nodes
Logging and monitoring infrastructure (CloudWatch, CloudTrail)

Stakeholders

DevOps/Platform Engineering Team
Information Security Team
Compliance/GRC Team
Application Development Teams

Next Steps

Assign technical lead for baseline development
Schedule stakeholder alignment meeting
Begin technical design and documentation
Establish testing environment for validation
