Technical Knowledge & Tools
Security Fundamentals:

"Walk me through the OWASP Top 10 - which vulnerabilities do you encounter most frequently?"
"How would you explain the difference between authentication and authorization to a junior developer?"
"Describe a time you identified and helped remediate a critical security vulnerability"

SAST/DAST/SCA Tools:

"What's your experience with SAST vs DAST tools? When would you use each?"
"Have you implemented security scanning in CI/CD pipelines? Which tools did you use?"
"How do you handle false positives in automated security scans?"
"What's your approach to dependency scanning and managing vulnerable packages?"

GitHub Actions & Azure Specific:

"How would you secure GitHub Actions workflows and prevent secret exposure?"
"What security considerations are important for self-hosted runners?"
"Describe how you'd implement security gates in a GitHub Actions pipeline"
"What Azure security services have you worked with? (Key Vault, Defender, Security Center, etc.)"

Practical Scenarios
Shift-Left Security:

"How would you integrate security into our SDLC without slowing down development?"
"Describe your approach to threat modeling for a new feature or application"
"How do you prioritize security findings when you have limited remediation resources?"

Incident Response:

"Walk me through how you'd respond to a suspected container escape in our runner environment"
"A developer accidentally committed AWS keys to a public repo - what are your immediate steps?"

Soft Skills & Culture Fit
Developer Collaboration:

"Tell me about a time you had to convince a resistant developer team to adopt security practices"
"How do you balance security requirements with delivery deadlines?"
"Describe a security training or awareness program you've implemented"

Teaching & Mentoring:

"Give an example of when you taught a developer about secure coding (like input validation, SQL injection prevention, or API security)"
"How would you help a team that keeps introducing the same security antipatterns?"

Red Team/Blue Team Experience
Offensive Security (if relevant):

"What's your experience with penetration testing or CTF competitions like Hack The Box?"
"How does offensive security experience help you in a defensive role?"
Rather than just "have you done Hack The Box," ask: "What's the most interesting vulnerability you've exploited in a CTF or lab environment?"

Architecture & Design
Security Architecture:

"How would you design security for a multi-tenant SaaS application?"
"Explain the concept of Zero Trust and how you'd implement it"
"What security controls would you implement for our GitHub runners handling customer code?"

Compliance & Governance

"What experience do you have with compliance frameworks (SOC2, ISO 27001, etc.)?"
"How do you document and track security controls?"
"Describe your approach to security policy creation and enforcement"

Red Flags to Watch For:

Can't explain basic concepts in simple terms
Only knows tool names but not how they work
No experience collaborating with developers
Overly focused on stopping everything vs. managing risk
Can't give specific examples from past experience

Good Follow-ups:

"What would you do differently if you could do that project again?"
"What was the business impact of that security improvement?"
"How did you measure success?"
