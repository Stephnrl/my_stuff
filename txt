Areas where additional support would enhance my effectiveness:
Strategic Alignment & Prioritization: As I continue to identify automation opportunities and technical improvements, regular strategic sessions to ensure my initiatives align with broader organizational priorities would be valuable. This would help me focus efforts on highest-impact areas.
Resource Access & Partnerships: For larger initiatives like the AWS expansion, having clearer pathways to engage with other teams (networking, security, compliance) would accelerate delivery. Establishing these cross-functional relationships early would prevent potential bottlenecks.
Professional Development Support: Continued support for certifications beyond AZ-104 would be valuable. Azure DevOps Expert or AWS certifications would directly enhance my ability to deliver on our cloud strategy.
Knowledge Sharing Platform: Creating opportunities to share learnings from projects like Iron Bank implementation and AWS IaC with broader IT teams could multiply the impact of these innovations across the organization.
Future Role Definition: As I continue to drive significant automation and cloud initiatives, clarity on potential career progression paths would help me focus skill development in areas most valuable to both my growth and organizational needs.
The current level of trust and autonomy has been instrumental in my success - maintaining this while adding these strategic supports would further enhance my ability to deliver transformational results."
This positions you as someone who's grateful for current support while thinking strategically about how to be even more effective.
