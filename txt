Highlight Areas for Future Focus:
1. Scaling Automation & IaC Excellence
Building on the AWS Landing Zone success, I want to expand IaC capabilities across our entire cloud footprint. This includes developing standardized Terraform modules, implementing automated compliance scanning, and creating self-service infrastructure templates that empower development teams while maintaining governance standards.
2. Cloud Strategy & Multi-Cloud Expertise
With AWS foundation established, focus on developing comprehensive multi-cloud strategies that optimize workload placement between Azure and AWS based on technical and cost considerations. This includes becoming the organization's cloud architecture advisor for new initiatives.
3. Advanced Security Automation
Expand on the Iron Bank pipeline success by implementing comprehensive security automation - automated vulnerability scanning, compliance reporting, and security policy enforcement across our infrastructure stack. Goal is to embed security into every deployment pipeline.
4. Team Knowledge Transfer & Mentorship
As the "go-to" technical resource, I want to focus on scaling my impact through knowledge sharing and mentoring. This includes creating comprehensive documentation, conducting technical training sessions, and developing other team members' troubleshooting capabilities.
5. DevOps Leadership & Strategy
Position myself as a technical leader who can guide our DevOps transformation strategy. This includes evaluating emerging technologies, defining best practices, and contributing to architectural decisions that shape our infrastructure future.
6. Professional Certification Growth
Complete AZ-104 and pursue AWS Solutions Architect certification to formally validate the cloud expertise I'm developing through hands-on work.
These focuses align my individual growth with organizational transformation needs while leveraging my proven strengths in automation and technical problem-solving.
