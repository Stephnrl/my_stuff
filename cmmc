GitHub Enterprise Server – External Connection Justification

System: GitHub Enterprise Server (self-hosted, Azure Gov)
Location: Private VNet, private DNS, egress via Hub firewall

External Connections Identified [a]:
1. api.github.com – Update/version API
2. github.com – Package downloads  
3. [license endpoint] – License validation

Use of External Systems [b]:
- Retrieve software updates and security patches
- Download packages required for GitHub Enterprise operation
- Validate software licensing with vendor

Verification of Connections and Use [c][e]:
- GitHub is a reputable vendor with established security practices
- Connections use TLS encryption (verified via firewall inspection/logging)
- Traffic is validated against expected patterns (update checks, 
  license validation only)
- Firewall logs reviewed [frequency] to confirm only expected 
  traffic to approved endpoints
- No anomalous egress or data exfiltration patterns observed

CUI Handling: None. GitHub Enterprise stores all repositories locally.
No CUI is transmitted to external GitHub endpoints.

Justification: Connections are vendor-required for licensing and 
security updates. Blocking would prevent patching and violate 
license terms.

Controls – Connection and Use Limited [d][f]:
- Egress restricted to specific GitHub FQDNs via Azure Firewall
- Traffic logged and monitored via [your SIEM]
- No inbound connections from internet to GitHub servers
- Access to GitHub admin functions restricted to authorized personnel
- Usage policies define acceptable use of GitHub within the environment
