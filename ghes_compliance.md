# FedRAMP High Compliance Assessment Report
## GitHub Enterprise Server and RHEL 9.0 Backup Utility Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive assessment of the FedRAMP High compliance requirements applicable to a GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) implementation with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.0 backup utility host. The assessment covers all relevant control families from NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5, with specific focus on the division of compliance responsibilities between GitHub's appliance and the organization's configuration and management practices.

## System Overview

The system consists of two primary components:
1. **GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)** - Provided as an appliance by GitHub
2. **RHEL 9.0 Backup Utility Host** - Organization-managed server running GitHub Backup Utilities

The system uses infrastructure as code (Terraform) for deployment and configuration management (Ansible) for consistent implementation of security controls.

## Responsibility Matrix

While GitHub provides many security controls as part of their appliance, the organization maintains responsibility for:
- Proper configuration of the GHES appliance
