Sample Write-Up Structure for [c] and [f]
Here's a practical template you could adapt:
[c] – Identified Systems Engineering Principles

The DevSecOps team has identified and documented the following security engineering principles that govern infrastructure provisioning and CI/CD operations:

Least Privilege Access – All Azure operations are performed via Service Principal Names (SPNs) scoped to specific GitHub repositories and environments with minimal RBAC permissions required for the task.
Logical Security Boundaries – Azure Landing Zones enforce subscription-level isolation. Each team receives a dedicated Resource Group with RBAC assignments, preventing cross-tenant or cross-team resource access.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – All baseline infrastructure is defined in Terraform, stored in version-controlled GitHub repositories, enabling audit trails, peer review, and repeatable deployments.
Cryptographic Standards Compliance – Self-hosted GitHub runners operate on Azure AKS nodes configured with FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules within the Azure GCC High environment.
Controlled Execution Environments – GitHub Actions workflows execute on managed, self-hosted runners rather than public shared infrastructure, reducing supply chain risk.
Secure Development Practices – SonarQube is integrated for code quality and security analysis.


[f] – Employment of Identified Principles

Evidence of implementation:

Terraform configurations in GitHub repositories enforce Landing Zone architecture (subscription isolation, RBAC, resource group provisioning)
GitHub Environment Protection Rules require approvals and restrict which branches can deploy to production
SPN credentials are stored in GitHub Secrets, scoped per environment, and rotated per policy
AKS node pools are provisioned with FIPS-enabled OS images (documented in Terraform/ARM templates)
SonarQube scan results are available for repositories under DevSecOps management
Pull Request workflows enforce review requirements before infrastructure changes merge
