[c] – Identified Systems Engineering Principles

The DevSecOps team has identified the following security engineering principles for infrastructure provisioning and CI/CD operations:

Least Privilege Access – Service Principals are scoped to specific repositories and environments with minimal RBAC permissions.
Logical Security Boundaries – Azure Landing Zones enforce subscription-level isolation with dedicated Resource Groups and RBAC assignments per team.
Infrastructure as Code – Baseline infrastructure is defined in Terraform, version-controlled in GitHub, enabling audit trails and peer review.
Secretless Authentication – GitHub-to-Azure authentication uses OIDC Workload Identity Federation, eliminating static credentials.
Controlled Execution Environments – GitHub Actions execute on self-hosted runners within Azure GCC High on FIPS 140-2 enabled AKS nodes.



[f] – Employment of Identified Principles

Evidence of implementation:

Terraform configurations enforce Landing Zone architecture (subscription isolation, RBAC, resource group provisioning)
Service Principal authentication uses OIDC federated credentials bound to specific repositories and environments
AKS node pools are provisioned with FIPS-enabled OS images
Pull Request workflows enforce review requirements before infrastructure changes merge
GitHub Environment Protection Rules restrict deployments to approved branches
