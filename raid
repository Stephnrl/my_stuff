Risk ID #,Date,Risk Name,Description of the impact if realized,Mitigation efforts/response,Chance of occurrence,Impact if realized,Notes
R001,2025-01-14,Service Downtime During Migration,"1-2 minutes network interruption per VM/NIC, potential business impact during migration","Schedule maintenance windows; Migrate in phases; Create detailed communication plan; Test recovery procedures",High,High,Each additional NIC adds ~1 minute downtime
R002,2025-01-14,Missing NSG Configuration,"Traffic blocked after migration - Standard SKUs are secure by default, Basic allows all","Pre-create NSGs with documented rules; Audit all current traffic patterns; Use -skipVMMissingNSG for assessment",Medium,High,Critical for maintaining connectivity post-migration
R003,2025-01-14,VMSS Public IP Changes,"Instance-level IPs will change, breaking external connections and DNS mappings","Document all current IPs; Prepare DNS update procedures; Notify all external partners/customers",High,Medium,IPs cannot be upgraded - only replaced
R004,2025-01-14,Script Failure Mid-Migration,"Resources left in inconsistent state, extended downtime, potential data loss","Test in sandbox first; Ensure backup files are created; Document -RecoverFromFile procedures; Have rollback plan",Low,High,Recovery files stored as PublicIPUpgrade_Recovery_*.csv
R005,2025-01-14,Multi-LB Dependencies,"Failure to migrate related LBs together causes mixing of SKUs (unsupported)","Map all LB relationships; Use -MultiLBConfig parameter; Coordinate simultaneous migration",Medium,High,Common with internal+external LB patterns
R006,2025-01-14,Loss of Outbound Connectivity,"Internal LBs lose default outbound access with Standard SKU, breaking internet access","Configure NAT Gateway post-migration; Setup Azure Firewall; Add secondary external LB; Document outbound requirements",High,High,Multiple solution options available
R007,2025-01-14,Service Fabric Extended Downtime,"SF clusters take ~1 hour to migrate vs standard 2-5 minutes","Separate maintenance window; Consider alternative migration approach; Stakeholder communication",Medium,High,Refer to SF-specific migration guidance
R008,2025-01-14,Unsupported Scenarios Discovery,"AKS clusters or IPv6 configurations found during migration attempt","Run validation queries pre-migration; Use -validateScenarioOnly parameter; Document all exceptions",Low,High,Cannot proceed with standard migration path
