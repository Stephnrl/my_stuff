## Issue Resolution: .NET 8 Image Build and Push to Azure ACR

I've completed the implementation of the requested .NET 8 image build and push to Azure ACR. The solution follows a two-stage approach:

### Stage 1: Hardened Base Image
- Created a hardened base image using UBI8-minimal/UBI9-minimal following Iron Bank security standards
- Implemented necessary security configurations and vulnerability remediations
- Successfully pushed the base image to our designated repository in Azure Container Registry

### Stage 2: .NET 8 Image Build
- Built upon the hardened base image to create both .NET 8 runtime and SDK images
- Incorporated all required dependencies and configurations
- Pushed the final images to the dotnet repository in our Azure Container Registry

### Implementation Details:
- All processes are fully automated via GitHub Actions workflows
- Added documentation in the repository describing the image build process
- Included validation steps to ensure image compliance with our security standards

The implementation is now complete and ready for review. Let me know if any adjustments are needed or if you'd like me to provide additional details about any specific part of the implementation.
