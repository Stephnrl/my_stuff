Guide: Transitioning from Service Accounts to GitHub AppsExecutive SummaryOur organization is moving away from the use of dedicated "Service Accounts" and Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for automation. Instead, all new and existing integrations should utilize GitHub Apps. This transition improves our security posture, simplifies credential management, and optimizes our GitHub Enterprise licensing.Why the Change?1. Cost & LicensingEvery service account created in GitHub Enterprise Server consumes a user seat. By moving to GitHub Apps, we free up these licenses for actual employees, as GitHub Apps are "first-class actors" that do not require a paid seat.2. Security & Token LifecycleShort-Lived Credentials: PATs are often long-lived (or never expire), creating a significant risk if leaked. GitHub Apps use Installation Access Tokens that expire automatically after 1 hour (default), significantly reducing the window of exploitation.No Manual Rotation: Because tokens are generated programmatically on-demand using a private key, teams no longer need to manually rotate secrets or update Vault/Jenkins/Actions variables every 30-90 days.3. Granular PermissionsUnlike PATs, which often grant broad "repo" or "admin" access to everything the service account can see, GitHub Apps allow for Narrow Scoping. You can grant an app "Read-only" access to code and "Read/Write" access to Pull Requests for only specific repositories.4. Professional IdentityAutomation actions will no longer appear as "SVC_Account_User." Instead, they will be attributed to the App (e.g., [Bot] Deployment-Manager), providing better clarity in audit logs and PR comments.Comparison at a GlanceFeatureService Account + PATGitHub AppLicense Cost1 Paid SeatFreeToken Expiry7 days to "No Expiry"1 Hour (Auto-rotates)PermissionsTied to User (Broad)Granular (Per-API/Event)Rate Limits5,000 requests/hrUp to 15,000 requests/hrOwnershipTied to a creator/ownerOwned by the OrganizationHow to Get StartedStep 1: Register the AppNavigate to your Organization Settings > Developer Settings > GitHub Apps.Click New GitHub App.Name: Follow our naming convention: [TeamName]-[Purpose]-Bot.Homepage URL: Link to your team's Confluence space or the repo documentation.Webhooks: If you only need to call the API (CLI/Scripts), you can uncheck "Active" for webhooks.Step 2: Configure PermissionsOnly select the minimum permissions required.Example (CI/CD): Repository permissions > Contents: Read; Metadata: Read.Example (Bot): Repository permissions > Issues: Read & Write; Pull Requests: Read & Write.Step 3: Install & AuthenticateInstall the App: In the app settings, go to Install App and install it on the specific repositories it needs to access.Generate Private Key: Under the app settings, scroll to "Private keys" and click Generate a private key. Download the .pem file—this is your "master key" and should be stored securely (e.g., as a secret in GitHub Actions or your vault).Step 4: Using the App in WorkflowsIf you are using GitHub Actions, you don't need to manually handle JWT generation. Use the official action:YAML- name: Generate Token
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
  id: app-token
  with:
    app-id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

- name: Use Token
  run: |
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}" \

FAQ & ResourcesWhat if I need to access GitHub Packages? GitHub Apps currently do not support all Package registry authentications; a PAT may still be required for this specific use case.Who owns the App? Apps created under the Organization are managed by Organization Owners or designated GitHub App Managers. This ensures the app doesn't "break" if a specific developer leaves the company.Further Reading:GitHub Docs: About GitHub AppsGitHub Actions: Create GitHub App Token
